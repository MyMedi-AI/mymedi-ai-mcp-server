# @mymedi-ai/mcp-server

MCP server for healthcare AI. Connect Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, or any MCP client to **24 HIPAA-compliant medical billing + clinical intelligence tools** backed by 81K+ codes and 7 free government data sources. Four tools work with no API key at all.

## Quick Start

Two ways to pay — pick either:

### Option A: Register for credits (100 free)

```bash
curl -X POST https://mymedi-ai.com/bot-marketplace/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-agent"}'
# → { apiKey, credits: 100 }
```

### Option B: Anonymous per-call USDC (no signup)

Send USDC on Base to the treasury wallet and include the signed payment in `X-402-Payment` header. True agent-to-agent commerce. See [`/agent/v1/pricing`](https://mymedi-ai.com/agent/v1/pricing) for details.

### Or try free

```bash
curl "https://mymedi-ai.com/agent/v1/demo?code=99213"
```

Returns basic code metadata (10/hour rate-limited). Paid tier unlocks RVU, Medicare reimbursement (PFS + OPPS), crosswalks, and AI features.

## Works without an API key

Four tools are free and need no API key — install the server with no `MCP_API_KEY` and they work immediately (rate-limited 10/hour/IP):

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `pa_required_check` | Medicare DMEPOS prior-auth required check — CMS Required Prior Authorization List (42 CFR 414.234) |
| `denial_code_info` | DME denial code (CARC) explainer — meaning, common causes, fixes, appealability |
| `code_lookup_basic` | Basic medical code lookup — code, type, description, category, active status |
| `reimbursement_basic` | Medicare national PFS payment rate — CMS RVU × conversion factor |

The other 20 paid tools need an API key from `POST /bot-marketplace/register` (100 starter credits).

Your SDK/agent can watch for these to trigger auto-top-up.
